An google sheet interface over database tables, secure your DB tables from direct access. 


Your data entry operator team, data analyst team or business analyst team always need DB access.
Rather then to give direct access to DB tables (which is problematic for them also as they neeed some kind of RDBMS client) give them access to google spreadsheet (excel file, which they knew better).
